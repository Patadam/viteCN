## History

### Design Brief
The [codenetwork.co](https://codenetwork.co) website as you see it now was originally developed by Jim Chi and Nathan Wang. Further changes and continued work to the site has been made by the Code Network infrastructure and development team in 2024. 

The website follows the 2023 style guide created by Drayko Medlyn and Shreya Arora's edit on the 2023 sponsorship prospectus. This website aims to improve the interactive experience by limiting relatively expensive user interaction. i.e. click (occupational disease prevention for developers and gamers), and scrolling (because who has time to read). Hence we are promoting a "peak and seek" interaction through effects like hover, animation and more. Attempt to gamify an information site, which seeks to inform.

### Our Thanks
To all the past, current and future contributors, Code Network developers, members and community who have worked to make this site the best it can be, we extend our gratitude for the time given to work on this site. Thank you.
