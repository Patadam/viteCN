Welcome to the Code Network (CN) public website Github repository. 

Code Network is a student-led organisation dedicated to
fostering a strong developer community for anyone interested
in code. We seek to develop our membersâ€™ skills through regular
talks, workshops, and Hackathons. We also offer networking
opportunities and social spaces for students to communicate,
collaborate and most importantly, build something awesome.

## Getting Started

### Installation
To get started first clone this repository to your local device and navigate into the `VITECN` folder. Then execute the following:

### If you are using NPM:

```

### If you are using Yarn:
```

## Changes to Events, CN Team and Sponsors
The key data and information for these pages is easily changed by accessing the `src/data/` directory and selecting the relevant JSON file and making the changes directly to that file, this information will then be read by the respective pages where necessary.

## Creating a new Page
The process for creating a new page has been simplified and an attempt to reduce boilerplate code has been made, further changes and improvements to this process may occur over time with feedback!

Create a new page in `src/pages/` with the `<Name>.jsx` format, include the following essentials and then you can add any further content.
```jsx
import Page from "../components/Page";
export default function PAGE_NAME_HERE() {
  return (
    <Page>
    {/* ALL YOUR PAGE CONTENT HERE */}
    </Page>
  )
}
```
### No border page
To remove the default Code Network green border add the `noborder` attribute to the `<Page>` element like this `<Page noborder>`

## History

### Design Brief
The [codenetwork.co](https://codenetwork.co) website as you see it now was originally developed by Jim Chi and Nathan Wang. Further changes and continued work to the site has been made by the Code Network infrastructure and development team in 2024. 

The website follows the 2023 style guide created by Drayko Medlyn and Shreya Arora's edit on the 2023 sponsorship prospectus. This website aims to improve the interactive experience by limiting relatively expensive user interaction. i.e. click (occupational disease prevention for developers and gamers), and scrolling (because who has time to read). Hence we are promoting a "peak and seek" interaction through effects like hover, animation and more. Attempt to gamify an information site, which seeks to inform.

### Our Thanks
To all the past, current and future contributors, Code Network developers, members and community who have worked to make this site the best it can be, we extend our gratitude for the time given to work on this site. Thank you.
